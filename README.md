# Angular and ThreeJS Boilerplate Project
This project is a boilerplate for building Angular applications with ThreeJS. It provides a basic structure for integrating ThreeJS into an Angular application and makes it easy to get started with building 3D graphics and animations.

### Features
Scene is contained in a scene container. This container is styled with CSS and the scene will fill this container.
All the elements of the scene are initialized through the ObjectService class, which provides a simple API for creating and manipulating objects in the scene.
The CameraService class provides a simple API for creating and positioning the camera within the scene.
The RenderService class provides a simple API for rendering the scene to the canvas element.
